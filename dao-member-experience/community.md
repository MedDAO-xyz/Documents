## MedDAO Stakeholders <a href="#working-groups" id="working-groups"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
Any individual is welcome to join MedDAO. We aim to create a globally connected community dedicated to sharing all medical knowledge and experience.
{% endhint %}

* **Healthcare professionals**- for those that have dedicated their lives to acquiring and applying their medical knowledge, MedDAO hopes to build a platform to allow these professionals to expand their medical networks , continue to and more effectively spread their knowledge.
* **Patients/Caregivers**- while patient facing use cases are contemplated they will not be the initial focus due to the serious and legal nature of patient care, however, we believe that by virtue of their experiences, patients and caregivers possess valuable expertise and foresee their involvement as a cornerstone of the MedDAO ecosystem. Ultimately, the mutual exchange of expertise and experience will result in novel use cases. These patient based subDAOs could materialize as self-advocate or help groups allowing patients to rally around a cause and more effectively aid a larger group of people.
* **Medical industry**- MedDAO sees great potential to work with medical industry participants in the capacity as partners, working together to expand networks and further their missions in advancing healthcare.
* **Academic institutions/researchers**- MedDAO hopes to help institutions and medical researchers in discovering new resources and finding new methods to collaborate.
* **Caused-based organizations**- organizations have traditionally been forced to rely upon fully centralized systems for their community engagement and platform development, we hope to allow these organizations to more easily communicate with those they’re trying to help as well as allow completely decentralized groups to form to serve their needs
* **Medicolegal experts**- we hope medicolegal experts will guide the DAO, defining the permissible activities and further defining the boundaries of Healthcare 3.0
* **Web3 natives / Developers**- the web3 community plays a crucial role in our success as they rally around the mission of MedDAO to aid in the architecture and continued growth of the DAO, protocol, and Healthcare 3.0
* **Regulators**- regulators are in place to ensure that medical consumers are protected from health risks and practitioners have a safe working environment. MedDAO expects to hold a close and compliant relationship with healthcare regulators to maintain the highest level of safety for its members and users.

## Working Groups <a href="#working-groups" id="working-groups"></a>

MedDAO proposes the formation of several working groups to complete the objectives of the DAO.

{% endhint %}

Initial working groups include:

### Dev working group

{% hint style="info" %}
Code-related, specifically the translation of clinical protocols and disease or clinical problem-related workstreams into code, and thus developers, software engineers, smart contract engineers, etc. would be key members
