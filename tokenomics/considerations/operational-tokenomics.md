### Hostile Voting Takeover <a href="#_9hdwavvqalgu" id="_9hdwavvqalgu"></a>

At the outset, anyone with governance tokens can vote on superDAO decisions, so we have to be mindful of allowing non-MedCred holders buying up tokens and swaying proposals. Initially, this can be handled by careful liquidity distribution, but as time goes on it may be prudent to limit voting to MedCred holders or switch to delegated voting. There are many creative solutions to tackle this in the future if the need arises.
