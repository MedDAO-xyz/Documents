# Platform Operations

## Platform <> superDAO Interaction <a href="#_esgykjgrzzi" id="_esgykjgrzzi"></a>

An important consideration is the intersection of the platform, the superDAO and governance. Processes that are not built in the current version of the platform will have to be implemented with human processes. For example, if a user disputes a knowledge request, the DAO will need to support the resolution of the dispute. As processes arise for how to resolve that, the platform can be engineered to implement those processes to support their occurrence and ensure a good user experience while supporting the end goal of the superDAO.

This is an important feature as the platform is developed as it allows for organic exploration of what components should be built in the next versions.

This could be something that is voted on and prioritized by the superDAO.
