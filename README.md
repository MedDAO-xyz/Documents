# Overview

## Introduction to MedDAO

Digitally enabled healthcare adoption has finally reached an inflection point, driven in large part by the COVID-19 pandemic and acceptance of tele-medicine as a viable care delivery model. Yet, even with these advancements, medical knowledge remains poorly distributed and poorly monetized. We believe Web3 will reshape the medical paradigm and create a new value layer in healthcare.

MedDAO is building a distributed medical knowledge network that will offer an exponentially greater degree of interaction and interconnection between healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders. These network effects have the potential to completely transform the way healthcare is delivered on a global scale.

## Mission, Vision & Values

### Mission

Our mission is to create a decentralized global community and protocol with the primary mission of distributing medical knowledge without boundaries, barriers of intermediaries. Our goal is to drive adoption and awareness of decentralized healthcare, or healthcare 3.0. This goal will be achieved through the collective participation of our community of healthcare providers, patients, caregivers and industry partners (legal, technology, research, etc.).

### Vision

We envision a new value layer in healthcare through the application of distributed ledger technology. This will:

* **Increase confidence** for patients, industry participants and physicians when it comes to making serious medical decisions.
* **Increase trust** in the knowledge available through multiple opinions & collective wisdom.
* **Reduce friction** by breaking down existing barriers to access (insurance, geographic, logistic, etc.).

### Values

MedDAO is founded on 3 core values: **ownership, accessibility and connectivity**. These north stars guide our practices and decisions, allowing us to deliver a new value layer of healthcare.

We believe that biggest opportunity in leveraging blockchain is to put ownership back into the hands of individuals:

* **For Physicians:** reclaim ownership of your practice of medicine
* **For Patients:** reclaim ownership of your healthcare journey and participate in a global healthcare community
* **For Industry Partners:** grow a network of meaningful & strategic relationships through a community with deep medical knowledge & patient-experience

## Baseplate / Hyperstructure for Healthcare 3.0

One of the long-term objectives in the MedDAO project is to build a so-called baseplate layer that would provide the abstractions, primitives and tooling for others to potentially extend it with many different implementations and applications. The SubDAOs built upon the MedDAO baseplate will accelerate the path to a globalized medical knowledge network.

Because of that, we're aiming for making our protocol architecture as extendable and modular as possible. It is of course should not stand in a way of delivering the initial MVP value, but is something we'd like to keep in mind when designing features.

## Conceptual Keystones

### What is Web3?

Web3 is a new phase of the internet built on a public blockchain. This new standard allows for a much greater level of decentralization, where users can not only read (web1), read/write (web2), but now read/write/own (web3). At its core the web3 environment is decentralized, permissionless and trustless.

### What is a DAO?

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) is an entity controlled by members rather than a central authority. Governance is transparent and documented using code or smart contracts for voting mechanisms and ultimately even to implement the changes. Members of a DAO are typically drawn together based on common interests.

### Why Web3?

Todayâ€™s medical industry has been built using a walled garden approach, with medical knowledge and data being controlled by massive and inherently centralized corporations, while medical professionals are increasingly marginalized to the role of mere employee. The healthcare industry continues to become increasingly dysfunctional, delivering inefficient care at skyrocketing costs and little to no transparency. The potential network effects of Healthcare 3.0 include but are not limited to the:

1. Globalization of medical knowledge
2. Expansions of medical professional networks
3. Sharing of patients and non-medical professionals medical knowledge
4. Immutable records improving the transparency and revealing the provenance of medical knowledge

Web3 empowers MedDAO to more closely address its core values of ownership, accessibility and connectivity.
