# Background

The intention of this document is to guide members of MedDAO in collaboratively executing the will of the DAO. It is therefore necessary to:

* Assure decentralized, fair and just governance of MedDAO and itâ€™s subDAOs
* Define genesis of the governance structures, roles & rights
* Provide guidelines for governance processes, including creating proposals and making consistent decisions as a DAO

This is the first iteration of our Governance Framework. Changes and improvements can be submitted in the form of proposals and the guidelines for accepting and implementing these changes are detailed below.
