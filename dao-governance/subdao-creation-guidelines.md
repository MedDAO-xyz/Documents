# SubDAO Creation Guidelines

MedDAO’s long-term goal is to have an ecosystem of successful, self-sustaining subDAOs where members conduct the majority of their activities. Once a group of MedDAO members have communicated, organized and feel it is appropriate to form a subDAO, they can do so via Formal Proposal.&#x20;

Here are the suggested requirements that should be met before a subDAO is created:

1. List of MedDAO members who would qualify for the subDAO’s proposed membership criteria and will make up the initial community
2. SubDAO Governance Framework in place. Those seeking to create a subDAO can use this document as a template. This document should also include the subDAO’s requirements for membership, including the gated NFT credentialing process.
   * SubDAO-gated NFT credentials - subDAOs will define their requirements for NFT credentials and who they want to admit into the subDAO. As an example, they could decide to only allow physicians of a certain subspeciality per the ABMS, a mix of physicians and non-physicians, or only non-physicians. Some examples for non-physician requirements could be:
     * [ ] Non-physician real world certifications
     * [ ] A knowledge exam for a specific area (healthcare admins, software dev, etc)
     * [ ] Sponsorship by an existing subDAO members
     * [ ] Patient advocates and/or support groups
     * [ ] Other requirements the subDAO designs
3. Initial workstream proposal including services to offer, service rates, and proposed take rates to the subDAO and MedDAO
4. Optionally, propose an initial subDAO treasury injection (from the MedDAO treasury)
