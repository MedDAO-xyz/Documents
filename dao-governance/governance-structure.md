# Governance Structure

## MedDAO Constitution

MedDAO has proposed and ratified its own constitution establishing its governance systems, fundamental rules, guiding values, and basic rights and protections for its participants.

MedDAO's Constitution can be found on our Discourse Forum:

## MedDAO Super/Sub Relationship

MedDAO operates as the superDAO with subDAO extensions.

## MedDAO as the superDAO

**At a high level, MedDAO owns governance decisions that touch a global variable, such as:**

* Changes to the overall DAO architecture, including the creation & destruction of subDAOs
* Add/change/remove Working Groups
* Actions from the MedDAO treasury, including requests for funding and setting minimum  take rates from future subDAO revenue
* Changes to overall governance structure, including MedDAO governance roles and elections, MedDAO member roles, and voting mechanisms

Most non-healthcare provider contributors operate in MedDAO working groups. They provide services that are key to the success of MedDAO, but which don’t make sense to be “owned” by the subDAO. Examples of working groups we envision at inception are described [here](../dao-member-experience/community.md#working-groups).

## SubDAOs

The purpose of subDAOs is to organize MedDAO members to optimize the DAO’s interactions with patients, companies, and any other medical knowledge or data seekers, providing value to those parties. SubDAOs can either be credentialed healthcare providers or aligned MedDAO members, for example a group of neurosurgeons could form their own credential-required subDAO; however, breast cancer survivors could also form their own subDAO to act as a digital support group or even allow industries and providers to engage with and/or benefit from their collective experiences.

SubDAOs run independently, but work together to allow the superDAO as a whole to function in its most meaningful and impactful way. Each subDAO inherently possesses its own agency and knowledge domains that must be given full autonomy to function optimally. A portion of each subDAO’s earnings will be allocated to MedDAO’s treasury to provide continuous support and enable future innovation for the DAO.

At genesis, we envision some subDAOs to be made up of credentialed medical practitioners grouped by subspecialties per the [American Board of Medical Specialties](https://www.abms.org/member-boards/specialty-subspecialty-certificates/) or other healthcare provider credentials (ex: Neurosurgery subDAO; OBGYN subDAO; Dentist subDAO). Membership to the subDAOs will be gated by NFT ownership. Ultimately, the MedDAO community is empowered to  propose and determine the requirements for the creation and membership of a subDAO when creating their proposal to form the subDAO.

{% hint style="info" %}
While we see great value creation derived from subDAOs of credentialed medical practitioners, we additionally see great potential for subDAOs to include many members outside of medical practitioners.  For example caused based organizations, patient self-advocate groups and many more.  For more information around MedDAO's key stakeholders please click [here](../dao-member-experience/community.md#working-groups).
{% endhint %}

**At a high level, subDAOs own governance decisions that do not impact MedDAO overall, such as:**

* Adding/changing/removing subDAO roles
* Changing a subDAO member’s status to Inactive if they’ve broken the Code of Conduct
* Creating and distributing NFT credentials to subDAO members to participate in governance and bounties
* Managing the subDAO treasury
* Establishing services to offer and rate, including subDAO take rate as long as they meet the MedDAO minimum standards
* Controlling and managing of subDAO data

## **Governance Roles**

MedDAO has 2 main governance roles:

* MedDAO Members - Members have the ability to vote on MedDAO Improvement Proposals and Informal Proposals at the MedDAO level
* SubDAO members - SubDAO members have the ability to vote at the subDAO level for any subDAO for which they hold membership.
