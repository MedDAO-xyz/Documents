# Proposals

## MedDAO Improvement Proposals (MIPs)

All MedDAO level decisions that do have an impact on governance structure or include requests for treasury funds are considered Formal Proposals. Here we will outline Formal Proposal Types, Process and Voting Rights.

### **Examples of Formal Proposals:**

1. Revising MedDAO Governance - a proposal to modify MedDAO roles and governance structure may be presented at any time. By default accepted changes will be put into place at the start of the next season unless otherwise specified. Examples include:
   * Creating Roles - new roles may be proposed at any time using this framework.
   * Eliminating Roles - roles that are no longer needed may be proposed to conclude at the end of the season using this framework.
   * Creation of subDAOs - new subDAOs and their joining criteria can be proposed at any time by the requisite number of members necessary to form a new subDAO
   * Destruction of subDAOs - subDAOs that are no longer active or providing value to its members may be proposed to conclude at the end of the season using this framework.
2. Requests for funding from the MedDAO treasury, such as project funds or bounties for Working Groups, or subDAOs
3. Changes to the MedDAO take rate for services rendered through use cases

## Informal Proposals

All MedDAO level decisions that are non-binding and have no impact on MedDAO funds, active roles, or governance. Informal proposals are to ensure transparency of operations. Voting on informal proposals will be conducted by discord polls in the appropriate channels.

### **Informal Proposal Processes:**

1. Proposals are presented in the `#informal-proposals` Discord channel
   * This allows Members to ask for clarification, present improvements and voice concerns
2. After an allotted period the Informal Proposal goes to a vote via a Discord poll. Approval or rejection is based on simple majority
