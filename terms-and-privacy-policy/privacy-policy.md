This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes the types of information MedDAO (“MedDAO”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) may collect, use and share when you visit the Server and/or use the products, features, materials, non-transferable and non-fungible tokens ("NFTs"), and services we offer (collectively with the MedDAO.xyz, the "Site", the “Services”). The Services also include your interaction with MedDAO’s members and its services, requests for and the issuance of any NFT from MedDAO, requests for, issuance of, and/or the use of any MedDAO token (should one come to exist) or other digital asset transacted through or involving the Server or any person or organization referenced herein, and potential eligibility for and participation in any Knowledge Requests (“KRs”).

The term “you” as used herein refers to users of the Server and the Services, MedDAO members, or Third-Party Collaborators, it being acknowledged that any particular individual, person, entity, or organization may be acting at the same time or from time to time in relation to MedDAO, the Server, and/or the Services in any one, all, or any combination of these roles or capacities.

MedDAO is a decentralized global community and, potentially in the future, a protocol, with the primary mission of distributing medical knowledge without boundaries, barriers of intermediaries to drive adoption and awareness of decentralized healthcare, or Healthcare 3.0. This mission will be achieved through the Services, which involve the collective participation of our community of healthcare providers, patients and industry partners (legal, technology, research, etc.), and KRs, which are one of the proposed use cases for MedDAO, its members, its users, and its Third-Party Collaborators. If and when KRs launch, it is contemplated that the Server will support medical industry KRs. In the future, we plan to expand KR use cases to include legal, government, research and other areas developed by subDAOs. In addition to members and users, the Services will be available to third party entities, persons, or associations who may request or solicit a KR (“Third Party Collaborators”).

To become a member, user, or Third-Party Collaborator, you may need to furnish us with your name, email address, blockchain address, applicable business entity, DAO, subDAO, organization, or unincorporated trust or association, along with your medical subspecialty and national provider identifier (NPI) or other means to verify you, in both cases if applicable (the “Eligibility Information”).
